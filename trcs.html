The same points of view in relation to the peace and people as with his sister, but does not harm nature, because he likes the environment of plants, and he himself can create his nature as his safe zone.<br>But only when there are people in this zone, Jaksu inserts anomaly in any places of his zone, so that people touching the anomaly will receive a strong blow to the explosion and loss of their lives, and it is considered as a trap for them.</p>
                    <p class="info">But also Jaksu doesn't want his sister to spoil his zone because it leads to protecting their shelters, so she decided at Jaksu's request to leave his zone. Jaksu, according to his sister's opinion, is also an unhappy boy, for what happened to him after the infections (Since the beginning of her sister's story), and Jaksu understood that he was actually calmed by someone, and politely loves his sister.</p>
